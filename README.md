# articulation-point-calculator

A vertex in an undirected connected graph is an articulation point (or cut vertex) if removing it (and edges through it) disconnects the graph. Articulation points represent vulnerabilities in a connected network â€“ single points whose failure would split the network into 2 or more disconnected components. They are useful for designing reliable networks.

For a disconnected undirected graph, an articulation point is a vertex removing which increases number of connected components.
